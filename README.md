# **Creating Helper Services to Send Network Requests**

## **1. Introduction**

When building distributed systems or microservices, it's common to need helper services or components that abstract and simplify the process of making network requests (e.g., HTTP calls) to external APIs or other services. These helper services are responsible for handling the low-level details of communication, such as retries, timeouts, authentication, and error handling, so that the consumer service/application can focus on higher-level business logic.

### **Goal:**
This document outlines the process for creating these helper services, including the key design principles, architecture, and implementation examples.

## **2. Design Principles**

The following principles should guide the development of your helper services:

### **2.1. Separation of Concerns**
The helper service should focus solely on handling network requests. It should not contain any business logic related to the consumer service's functionality. This allows the consumer service to remain focused on its core tasks.

### **2.2. Reusability**
Your helper service should be generic enough to handle different types of network requests, be it HTTP, gRPC, WebSockets, etc. It should expose a simple and consistent API that can be used across different parts of your application.

### **2.3. Error Handling and Resilience**
The helper service should handle network failures gracefully. It should implement retries, timeouts, and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable communication with external services.

### **2.4. Security**
Ensure that sensitive data such as API keys, authentication tokens, and credentials are securely handled and transmitted. Consider encryption, secure storage, and safe injection practices.

### **2.5. Logging and Monitoring**
Your helper service should include logging for success and failure cases, along with metrics for performance monitoring (e.g., request durations, success/error rates).

### **2.6. Asynchronous Support**
Where possible, support asynchronous communication, especially for I/O-bound operations. This can improve scalability and responsiveness of the consumer application.

## **3. Architecture**

The architecture of the helper service should be simple but robust. Below is an example of a typical design pattern for such a service:

### **3.1. High-Level Architecture**

```plaintext
+-------------------+    +------------------+    +--------------------+
| Consumer Service  |--->| Helper Service   |--->| External API / Other|
|                   |    | (Network Request)|    | Service (HTTP, gRPC,|
|                   |    |                  |    | WebSockets, etc.)  |
+-------------------+    +------------------+    +--------------------+
```

### **3.2. Key Components**

1. **Consumer Service**: The application or service that needs to send network requests to external systems. This is the client-facing application that interacts with the helper service.
   
2. **Helper Service**: A middleware service responsible for sending network requests. It abstracts the complexity of the actual network communication.
   
3. **External API / Service**: The remote API or system that the consumer service needs to communicate with. It could be an internal microservice or an external third-party API.

## **4. Key Features and Considerations for Helper Services**

### **4.1. API Interface Design**

Design a simple and intuitive API for the helper service that the consumer service will use to make requests. It could be a synchronous or asynchronous interface, depending on your use case.

#### **Example of Helper Service Interface:**

```python
class NetworkHelperService:
    def send_get_request(self, url: str, headers: dict = None, params: dict = None) -> dict:
        pass

    def send_post_request(self, url: str, headers: dict = None, data: dict = None) -> dict:
        pass
    
    def send_authenticated_request(self, url: str, token: str, method: str, data: dict = None) -> dict:
        pass
```

---

### **4.2. Handling Network Requests**

The helper service should manage network requests, including:

- **Making the Request**: Use appropriate libraries or frameworks (e.g., `requests` in Python, `http` module in Node.js).
- **Handling Response**: Handle successful responses (e.g., JSON parsing) and errors (e.g., timeouts, 4xx/5xx HTTP errors).
- **Retries**: Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging requests.
- **Headers & Authentication**: Support customizable headers (e.g., for authentication or content type).

#### **Example: HTTP Request with Retries**

```python
import requests
import time

class NetworkHelperService:
    def __init__(self, max_retries=3, timeout=10):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.timeout = timeout

    def send_get_request(self, url: str, headers: dict = None, params: dict = None) -> dict:
        retries = 0
        while retries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params, timeout=self.timeout)
                response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for HTTP errors
                return response.json()
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                retries += 1
                if retries >= self.max_retries:
                    raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch {url} after {self.max_retries} attempts") from e
                time.sleep(2 ** retries)  # Exponential backoff

        return {}

```

### **4.3. Authentication and Security**

For secure communication with external services, the helper service should support:

- **OAuth2**: If the external service requires OAuth authentication, the helper service can manage token acquisition and refreshing.
- **API Keys**: The helper service should be able to include API keys or bearer tokens in request headers for authenticated communication.
- **Encryption**: Ensure that sensitive data, such as tokens or credentials, is stored and transmitted securely.

Example: Sending an authenticated GET request with a Bearer Token:

```python
def send_authenticated_request(self, url: str, token: str, method: str = "GET", data: dict = None) -> dict:
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    response = requests.request(method, url, headers=headers, json=data, timeout=self.timeout)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

---

### **4.4. Error Handling**

The helper service should handle various errors, such as:

- **Network Errors**: Handle timeouts, connection errors, and other network-related issues.
- **HTTP Errors**: Check the HTTP response status code and handle 4xx or 5xx errors accordingly.
- **API-Specific Errors**: Some APIs return specific error codes or messages. Make sure to parse and handle these as needed.

Example of a generic error handler:

```python
def handle_error(self, error):
    if isinstance(error, requests.exceptions.Timeout):
        return {"error": "Timeout occurred, please try again later."}
    elif isinstance(error, requests.exceptions.HTTPError):
        return {"error": f"HTTP error occurred: {error.response.status_code}"}
    else:
        return {"error": f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(error)}"}
```

---

## **5. Example Usage in a Consumer Service**

The consumer service should use the helper service to perform network requests. Hereâ€™s an example of how it can interact with the helper service:

```python
class ConsumerService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.network_helper = NetworkHelperService()

    def fetch_data(self, url: str):
        try:
            response = self.network_helper.send_get_request(url)
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to fetch data: {e}")
            return None
```

---

## **6. Conclusion**

Creating a helper service that abstracts the complexity of network requests is an effective way to simplify the communication layer in your distributed systems. By focusing on separation of concerns, error resilience, security, and reusability, you can build a robust helper service that will serve your consumer application well.

Make sure to design a clear and consistent API, implement proper error handling, and include security measures to safeguard sensitive information.
